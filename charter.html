      <!-- delete PROPOSED after AC review completed -->

      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="">Private Advertising Technology Working Group</a>,
         motivated by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/">W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles</a>, is to
         specify web features and APIs that support advertising while
         acting in the interests of users, in particular providing strong
         privacy assurances using predominantly technical means.  The Working Group welcomes participation from
         browser vendors, OS vendors, mobile application vendors, advertisers,
         publishers, ad buyers, advertising platforms and intermediaries,
         privacy advocates, web application developers, and other interested
         parties.

        <h2>Motivation and Background</h2>
		<section id="section-background-origins">
			<h3>Origins</h3>
			<p>
				The Private Advertising Technology Working Group arose from efforts to implement privacy-forward technology and standards which support and evolve use cases that, until this point, have been dependent on third-party cookies and other tracking mechanisms. The initial approach to this topic was at the <a href="https://www.w3.org/community/web-adv/" target="_blank">Improving Web Advertising Business Group</a> which worked to define requirements and engage with the community to understand the needs of the advertising ecosystem. The work that started there has generated work taken up by a variety of other, more focused, groups.
			</p>
			<p>
				The groups that formed to help generate new standards and processes around privacy technologies at the W3C included the Private Advertising Technology Community Group (PATCG). This group has taken up community engagement to incubate web features and APIs that support advertising while acting in the interests of users, in particular providing strong privacy assurances using predominantly technical means. Some of the work incubated in that group has become mature enough to be taken up by a Working Group. The PATWG group was proposed to be chartered to take up work which reaches that state in PATCG. It also is prepared for work that matches our <a href="#mission">mission</a> and <a href="#scope">scope</a> and is ready to be taken up by a working group. 
			</p>
		</section>
		<section id="section-background-motivation">
			<h3>Motivation</h3>
			<p>
				This group is motivated by our <a href="#mission">mission</a> and the need for a commercially sustainable web. We understand that such a web is accessed through user agents and those user agents should act in the interest of their users and provide strong assurances of privacy. Our concerns are focused on supporting and creating an environment where the many ad-driven stakeholders who build the web, and are interested in operating within the limitations of our <a href="#scope">scope</a>, can find usable and useful processes by which to operate. 
			</p>
		</section>
    </section>

    <section id="scope" class="scope">
        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
            The Working Group will specify new web platform features. The purpose of
            these features is to support web advertising without compromising
            user privacy.  Here "privacy" minimally refers to appropriate
            processing of personal information.  Ways in which new features might
            enable inappropriate processing include (but are not limited to)
            enabling
            of <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/DNOTE-privacy-principles-20230223/#dfn-cross-site-recognition">cross-site
            or cross context recognition</a> of users or
            enabling <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/2023/DNOTE-privacy-principles-20230223/#dfn-same-site-recognition">same-site
            or same-context recognition</a> of users across the clearing of
            state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group will produce specifications that are implemented by
          user agents.  The implementation of specifications in user agents
          might interoperate with or depend on functionality provided by other
          entities.  In these cases, the Working Group
          will <a href="#coordination">coordinate with other organizations</a>
          to provide specifications for necessary functions.

          <h3 id="out-of-scope">Out of Scope</h3>

        <p><i>Draft state</i> indicates the state of the deliverable at the time of the charter approval.
          The Working Group intends to publish the latest state of their work as Candidate Recommendation (with Snapshots) and does not intend to advance their documents further in this charter period.</p>

            Normative Specifications
          </h3>
          <p>
            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="private-attribution" class="spec"><a href="https://github.com/patcg/private-measurement">Private Attribution Measurement</a></dt>
            <dd>
              <p>This specification defines how to privately measure advertisement attribution/conversion without revealing whether any individual user converts or does not.</p>
              <p class="draft-status"><b>Draft state:</b> No draft</p>
              <p class="milestone"><b>Expected completion:</b> Q3 2025</p>
			  <p>The proposal will work with concepts and take inspiration from:</p>
			  <ul>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/ipa"></a>Interoperable Private Attribution (IPA)</li>
				<li><a href="https://github.com/privacycg/private-click-measurement/">Private Click Measurement</a></li>

				<li><a href="https://github.com/patcg-individual-drafts/private-ad-measurement">Prio-like Attribution Measurement</a></li>
			  </ul>
			  <p>
				The proposal will arise from the dimensions set in the <a href="https://github.com/patcg/docs-and-reports/tree/main/design-dimensions">Design Dimensions document</a> and will be guided by the <a href="https://github.com/patcg/docs-and-reports/tree/main/threat-model">threat model</a> and <a href="https://github.com/patcg/docs-and-reports/tree/main/principles">principles documents</a> initiated by PATCG.

            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
            The Working Group intends to add other normative specifications as the technology becomes ready. The expectation is that those specifications will be incubated in the PATCG and then, when they are ready for standardization, transition to PATWG. Potential areas include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pre-campaign planning</li>
            <li>Intra-campaign decisioning and optimization, such as:</li>
            <ul>
              <li>Interest-based ad or content decisioning;</li>
              <li>User List Marketing/Remarketing;</li>
              <li>Fraud detection and prevention;</li>
              <li>Abuse detection and prevention;</li>
              <li>Frequency and recency controls;</li>
              <li>Error reporting and mitigation; and </li>

          <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
          <p>The WG will progress its normative specifications through the following
    standardization process:
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#RecsWD">First Public
      Working Draft</a>,
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#RecsWD">Working
      Draft</a>,
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#candidate-recommendation-snapshot">Candidate
      Recommendation Snapshot</a>, and <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#candidate-recommendation-draft">Candidate
      Recommendation Draft</a>. The WG does not intend to publish specifications as <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#RecsPR">Proposed Recommendations</a>.

    <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>

    <p>To promote interoperability, all changes made to specifications in Candidate Recommendation or to features that have deployed implementations should have tests. Testing efforts should be conducted via the Web Platform Tests project.</p>
    
    <p>Each specification should contain sections detailing all known security and
      privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

    <p>Each specification should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximizing accessibility in implementations.</p>
    
    <!-- Design principles -->
    <p>This Working Group expects to follow the
      TAG <a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/design-principles/">Web Platform Design Principles</a>.
    </p>

    <p>All new features should have expressions of interest from at least two potential implementors before being incorporated in the specification.</p>
    
    <p>In considering features, the group will state, during the development of those features or in the text of the document, privacy implications. Proposals should clearly state privacy issues, how they intend to address those issues, and the advertising use cases addressed in each deliverable.</p>
    </section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.
          Additionally, the technologies this Working Group will be considering will be relevant for other standards development organizations
          such that the group is encouraged to coordinate with the appropriate groups at IETF, and others as needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The WG will coordinate with the Private Advertising Technology Community Group to solicit feedback from a wider community of interest. At any time, but always when a specification is undergoing a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#rec-track" title="The W3C Recommendation Track">state change</a>, the WG will ask the CG for feedback. The WG will allow the CG at least 4 weeks to gather that feedback.

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in public: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, as participation is limited to Working Group members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about this Working Group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the PATWG Working Group Home Page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

        </p>
        <p>
          At the discretion of the Chairs and subject to a consensus call, the Working Group may designate a task force to study a particular subject and report back to the Working Group their findings and a recommendation. A task force will consist of a small group of volunteers who commit to investing significant amounts of time on the task over a short, time-bound, period.
        </p>
        <p>Task forces operate under the same policies as the Working Group.</p>
        <p>
          This Working Group primarily conducts its technical work in the PATWG GitHub repository, which is configured to send all issues and pull requests to the public mailing list: <span class='todo'>public-[email-list]@w3.org</span> (archive). The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.         </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

        <h2>
          Decision Policy
        </h2>
        <p>
          This Working Group will seek to make decisions through
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Consensus">consensus</a> and the documented decision making process of <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#decisions" title="Decisions section of W3C Process Document">the W3C Process Document
          (Section 5, Decisions)</a>. Typically, an editor or other
          participant makes an initial proposal, which is then refined
          in discussion with members of the Working Group and other
          reviewers, and consensus emerges with little formal voting
          being required.
        </p>
        <p>
          After discussion in a GitHub issue and other informal
          discussion, substantive change proposals should be submitted
          as GitHub pull requests. These can come from the editors or
          from WG members. Editors are responsible for “curating” the
          pull requests to reject frivolous ones and substantive ones
          that the Chairs have determined do not comply with the IPR
          policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chairs are responsible for determining whether or not there is WG
          consensus for the changes contained in a pull request.
          Unanimity is not required, but the Chairs should strive to
          make consensus decisions where there is significant support
          and few abstentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and
          consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the
          range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a Working
          Group vote and record a decision along with any formal
          objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one
          week to 10 working days, depending on the Chair's evaluation of the
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the
          response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the Working Group should be considered resolved
          unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened
          at the discretion of the Chairs.
        </p>
        <p>
          This charter is written in accordance with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#Votes">W3C Process Document
          (Section 5.2.3, Deciding by Vote)</a> and includes no voting procedures
          beyond what the Process Document requires.
