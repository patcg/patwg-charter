      <!-- delete PROPOSED after AC review completed -->

      <p class="mission">The <strong>mission</strong> of the <a href="">Private Advertising Technology Working Group</a>
         motivated by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/ethical-web-principles/">W3C TAG Ethical Web Principles</a>, is to
         specify web features and APIs that support advertising while
         acting in the interests of users, in particular providing strong
         privacy assurances.  The Working Group welcomes participation from
         browser vendors, OS vendors, mobile application vendors, advertisers,
         publishers, ad buyers, advertising platforms and intermediaries,
         privacy advocates, web application developers, and other interested
         parties.

        <h2>Scope</h2>
        <p>
            The Working Group will specify new web platform features intended to
            be implemented in browsers or similar user agents. The purpose of
            these features is to support web advertising without compromising
            user privacy.  Here "privacy" minimally refers to appropriate
            processing of personal information.  Ways in which new features might
            enable inappropriate processing include (but are not limited to)
            enabling
            of <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/privacy-principles/#hl-recognition-cross-site">cross-site
            or cross context recognition</a> of users or
            enabling <a href="https://w3ctag.github.io/privacy-principles/#hl-recognition-same-site">same-site
            or same-context recognition</a> of users across the clearing of
            state.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group may consider designs that allow user agents for the
          same user — including non-browser agents, like Operating Systems — to
          collaborate in providing advertising features.

            The Working Group will deliver the following W3C normative specifications:
          </p>
          <dl>
            <dt id="private-attribution" class="spec"><a href="#">Private Attribution Measurement</a></dt>

              <p>This specification defines how to privately measure advertisement attribution/conversion rates without revealing whether any individual user converts or does not.</p>
            </dd>
          </dl>

          <p>
            The Working Group intends to add other normative specifications as the technology becomes ready. The expectation is that those specifications will be incubated in the PATCG and then, when they are ready for standardization, transition to PATWG. Potential areas include:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Pre-campaign planning</li>

        <section id="success-criteria">
          <h2>Success Criteria</h2>
          <p>The WG will progress its normative specifications through the following
    standardization process:
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#RecsWD">First Public
      Working Draft</a>,
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#RecsWD">Working
      Draft</a>,
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#candidate-recommendation-draft">Candidate
      Recommendation Draft</a>, and
    <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#candidate-recommendation-snapshot">Candidate
      Recommendation Snapshot</a>.
    It is expected that to reach the Candidate Recommendation Snapshot stage, each normative
    specification is expected to have <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#implementation-experience">at least two independent implementations</a> of every feature defined in the specification.</p>

          <p>Each normative specification should contain separate sections detailing all known security and privacy implications for implementers, Web authors, and end users.</p>

          <p>There should be testing plans for each specification, starting from the earliest drafts.</p>

    <p>Normative specifications which have user-facing features should contain a section on accessibility that describes the benefits and impacts, including ways specification features can be used to address them, and recommendations for maximizing accessibility in implementations.</p>
        </section>

      <section id="coordination">
        <h2>Coordination</h2>
        <p>For all specifications, this Working Group will seek <a href="https://www.w3.org/Guide/documentreview/#how_to_get_horizontal_review">horizontal review</a> for
          accessibility, internationalization, performance, privacy, and security with the relevant Working and
          Interest Groups, and with the <a href="https://www.w3.org/2001/tag/" title="Technical Architecture Group">TAG</a>.
          Invitation for review must be issued during each major standards-track document transition, including
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsWD" title="First Public Working Draft">FPWD</a>.  The
          Working Group is encouraged to engage collaboratively with the horizontal review groups throughout development of
          each specification.  The Working Group is advised to seek a review at least 3 months before first entering
          <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#RecsCR" title="Candidate Recommendation">CR</a> and is encouraged
          to proactively notify the horizontal review groups when major changes occur in a specification following a review.
          Additionally, the technologies this Working Group will be considering will be relevant for other standards development organizations
          such that the group is encouraged to coordinate with the appropriate groups at the WHATWG, Ecma, and IETF as needed.
        </p>

        <p>
          The WG will coordinate with the Private Advertising Technology Community Group to solicit feedback from a wider community of interest. At any time, but always when a specification is undergoing a <a href="https://www.w3.org/2021/Process-20211102/#rec-track" title="The W3C Recommendation Track">state change</a>, the WG will ask the CG for feedback. The WG will allow the CG at least 4 weeks to gather that feedback.

        <p>Additional technical coordination with the following Groups will be made, per the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#WGCharter">W3C Process Document</a>:</p>

To be successful, this Working Group is expected to have 6 or more active participants originating from more than 2 separate parties for its duration, including representatives from the key implementors of this specification, and active Editors and Test Leads for each specification. The Chairs, specification Editors, and Test Leads are expected to contribute half of a working day per week towards the Working Group. There is no minimum requirement for other Participants.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Working Group encourages questions, comments and issues on its public mailing lists and document repositories, as described in <a href="#communication">Communication</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The group also welcomes non-Members to contribute technical submissions for consideration upon their agreement to the terms of the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Patent-Policy/">W3C Patent Policy</a>.
        </p>
        <p>Participants in the group are required (by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#ParticipationCriteria">W3C Process</a>) to follow the

        <p id="public">
          Technical discussions for this Working Group are conducted in public: the meeting minutes from teleconference and face-to-face meetings will be archived for public review, and technical discussions and issue tracking will be conducted in a manner that can be both read and written to by the general public. Working Drafts and Editor's Drafts of specifications will be developed in public repositories and may permit direct public contribution requests. The meetings themselves are not open to public participation, as participation is limited to Working Group members.
        </p>
        <p>
          Information about this Working Group (including details about deliverables, issues, actions, status, participants, and meetings) will be available from the PATWG Working Group Home Page.
        </p>
        <p>
          Most Working Group teleconferences will focus on discussion of particular specifications, and will be conducted on an as-needed basis.

        </p>
        <p>
          At the discretion of the Chairs and subject to a consensus call, the Working Group may designate a Design Team to study a particular subject, and report back to the Working Group their findings and a recommendation. These Design Teams shall consist of a small group of volunteers who commit to investing significant amounts of time on the task over a short, time-bound, period.
        </p>
        <p>When volunteers are available the chairs will endeavor to make such Design Teams filled with a diverse set of stakeholders including participants at multiple levels of the ad ecosystem.</p>
        <p>
          This Working Group primarily conducts its technical work in the PATWG GitHub repository, which is configured to send all issues and pull requests to the public mailing list: public-[email-list]@w3.org (archive). The public is invited to review, discuss and contribute to this work.         </p>
        <p>
          The group may use a Member-confidential mailing list for administrative purposes and, at the discretion of the Chairs and members of the group, for member-only discussions in special cases when a participant requests such a discussion.

          being required.

        <p>
          After discussion in a GitHub issue and other informal
          discussion, substantive change proposals should be submitted
          as GitHub pull requests. These can come from the editors or
          from WG members. Editors are responsible for “curating” the
          pull requests to reject frivolous ones and substantive ones
          that the Chairs have determined do not comply with the IPR
          policies.
        </p>
        <p>
          Chairs are responsible for determining whether or not there is WG
          consensus for the changes contained in a pull request.
          Unanimity is not required, but the Chairs should strive to
          make consensus decisions where there is significant support
          and few abstentions.
        </p>
        <p>
          However, if a decision is necessary for timely progress and
          consensus is not achieved after careful consideration of the
          range of views presented, the Chairs may call for a Working
          Group vote and record a decision along with any formal
          objections.
        </p>
        <p>
          To afford asynchronous decisions and organizational deliberation, any
          resolution (including publication decisions) taken in a face-to-face
          meeting or teleconference will be considered provisional. A call for
          consensus (CfC) will be issued for all resolutions (for example, via
          GitHub issue or web-based survey), with a response period from one
          week to 10 working days, depending on the Chair's evaluation of the
          consensus on the issue. If no objections are raised by the end of the
          response period, the resolution will be considered to have consensus
          as a resolution of the Working Group.
        </p>
        <p>
          All decisions made by the Working Group should be considered resolved
          unless and until new information becomes available or unless reopened
          at the discretion of the Chairs or the Director.
        </p>
